#
# About:
#
#  Prompt for a string and then output it, surrounded by a series of
#  stars. This demonstrates trap 0x01 (read from stdin) and trap
#  0x02 (remove newline).
#
# Usage:
#
#  go run . run ./examples/trap.in
#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  go run . compile ./examples/trap.in
#  go run . execute ./examples/trap.raw
#
# Example:
#
#  If the user enters "orange" they will see the following output:
#
#   ********
#   * Name *
#   ********

    store #1, "Please enter your name: "
    print_str #1

    # read a string from the console, then set the result in register #0
    trap 0x01

    # remove newline from the string in register #0
    trap 0x02

    # call a subroutine to output the boxed result
    call box
    exit

#
# This function prints out the string in register #0 in a box. For example if the input
# string in register #0 is "orange" the output will be:
#
#   ********
#   * Name *
#   ********
#

:box
    # copy string from #0 to #2
    store #2, #0
    # find the length of the string in register #0 and store it in the same register
    print_int #0
    trap 0x00

    # add two stars to each side to box the string
    inc #0
    inc #0
    inc #0
    inc #0

:header
    store #1, "*"
    print_str #1
    dec #0
    jmp_nz header

    store #1, "\n*"
    print_str #1
    print_str #2
    store #1, "*\n"
    print_str #1

    # repeat the process to print stars under the string
    store #0, #2
    # find the length of the string in register #0 and store it in the same register
    trap 0x00

    # add two stars to each side to box the string
    inc #0
    inc #0
    inc #0
    inc #0

:footer
    store #1, "*"
    print_str #1
    dec #0
    jmp_nz footer

    store #1, "\n"
    print_str #1
    ret
