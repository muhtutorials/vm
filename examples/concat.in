# About:
#
#  Use a conditional jump to loop ten times, building up a string as we go.
#
# Usage:
#
#  go run . run ./examples/concat.in
#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  go run . compile ./examples/concat.in
#  go run . execute ./examples/concat.raw
#

    store #1, "Counting bananas:\n"
    print_str #1

    store #1, 10
    store #2, 1
    store #3, ""
    store #4, " banana"

:repeat
    # this means "reg1 = reg1 - reg2"
    sub #1, #1, #2

    concat #3, #3, #4
    print_str #3

    store #5, "\n"
    print_str #5

    # the jump only occurs if the zero flag is set
    jmp_nz repeat

    store #1, "Done!\n"
    print_str #1

    exit
