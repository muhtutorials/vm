#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  go run . compile ./examples/mem_cpy.in
#  go run . execute ./examples/mem_cpy.raw
#

    jmp run

:code
    #
    # this is the code that gets copied and executed
    #
    store #1, "mem_cpy works!\n"
    print_str #1
    exit
:code_end

:run
    #
    # copy the memory between 'code' and 'code_end' to 0x5000
    #
    # calculate the length
    store #2, code
    store #3, code_end
    sub #3, #3, #2

    store #1, "code length is "
    print_str #1
    print_int #3
    store #1, "\n"
    print_str #1

    store #1, 0x5000
    mem_cpy #1, #2, #3

    # jump to the copied code
    jmp 0x5000
