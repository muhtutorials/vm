#
# About:
#
#  This example uses 'peek' to read a string character by character
#  and output the length of that string.
#
#  Unfortunately we can't output the string itself as we have no
#  "print character" option.
#
# Usage:
#
#  go run . run ./examples/peek_str_len.in
#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  go run . compile ./examples/peek_str_len.in
#  go run . execute ./examples/peek_str_len.raw
#

    #
    # #0 -> read each byte here
    #
    # #1 -> length of string
    #
    # #2 -> address of string
    #

    store #1, 0x00
    store #2, string

:loop
    # bytecode value at index contained in #2 saved to #0
    peek #0, #2
    inc #1
    inc #2
    cmp #0, 0x00
    jmp_nz loop

    # length will be one too many, so decrease by one
    dec #1

    store #2, "the length of the string is "
    print_str #2
    print_int #1
    store #2, " bytes\n"
    print_str #2
    exit

:string
    data "banana"
    data 0x00
