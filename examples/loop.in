#
# About:
#
# Use a conditional jump to loop ten times, the conditional will be triggered
# if a "SUB" operation results in <= 0.
#
# Usage:
#
#  go run . run ./examples/loop.in
#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  go run . compile ./examples/loop.in
#  go run . execute ./examples/loop.raw
#

    store #1, "Counting from ten to zero:\n"
    print_str #1

    store #1, 11
    store #2, 1

:repeat
    # this means "reg1 = reg1 - reg2"
    sub #1, #1, #2
    print_int #1

    # add new line to the output
    store #5, "\n"
    print_str #5

    # the jump only occurs if the zero flag is set
    jmp_nz repeat

    store #1, "Done!"
    print_str #1

    exit
